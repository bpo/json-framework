JSON Objective-C Framework
==========================

This framework contains a collection of categories on existing Cocoa
classes that together provide full JSON support. Importing the
<JSON/JSON.h> header provides the following main methods:

    -[NSArray JSONString];
    -[NSDictionary JSONString];
    -[NSString objectFromJSON];

Strictly speaking JSON has to have at least one top-level container
(array or object/dictionary). Nulls, numbers, booleans and strings
cannot be represented in strict JSON on their own. It can be quite
convenient to pretend that such JSON fragments are valid JSON and the
following methods will let you do so:

    -[NSNull JSONStringFragment];
    -[NSNumber JSONStringFragment];
    -[NSString JSONStringFragment];
    -[NSString objectFromJSONFragment];

Mapping between JSON and Objective-C types
------------------------------------------

Here's how the distinct JSON types map to Objective-C types.

    Object  <=> NSDictionary
    Array   <=> NSArray
    String  <=> NSString
    Null    <=> NSNull
    Boolean <=> NSNumber[*]
    Number  <=  NSNumber[*]
    Number   => NSDecimalNumber[*]

Going from JSON boolean "true" and "false" turn into NSNumber
instances (created with +numberWithBool:), while normal numbers turn
into NSDecimalNumber instances. Going to JSON is a bit more subtle. If
the instance was created with +numberWithBool: it will be represented
by the JSON fragment "true" or "false". Otherwise, it will be
represented by a normal number.

Note that in JSON the keys of a dictionary/object must be strings. In
Objective-C they need not be, but attempting to convert a dictionary
with non-string keys into JSON will throw an exception.
