    I got the idea to use a category on NSScanner for the core of the
    JSON parser from Blake's BSJSONAdditons project. This led me to
    completely abandon a stand-alone JSON class which cleared up the
    public interface considerably.

    Part of the inspiration for my JSON work has been from Marc's
    JSON::XS Perl module. I also adopted the way he organised the
    tests. Having a separate fixture for testing error conditions
    makes a lot of sense.

    Jens emailed me out of the blue one day with a couple of patches
    that gave a speedup of 11x for generation and 5x for parsing of
    the long (12k) JSON string I've been using for testing.
