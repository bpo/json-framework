Initial measurements comparing this library and BSJSONAdditions. The
difference in encoding speed is quite small, particularly for short
strings. For decoding, particularly for long strings, the difference
in speed is pronounced.

The difference in decoding speed might be because BSJSONAdditions
supports embedded C-style comments. (Comments are not part of the JSON
spec, but are valid JavaScript.)

Short string
